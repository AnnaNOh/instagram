## Code Example

#### Comments
The comments section was one of the biggest challenges I've faced while working on this project. After refactoring the comments section, there was no way for me to distinguish the html elements for styling, until I interpolated a passed in prop stating, where the comments were coming from into the className for the html elements.


## Future Features
#### Search Bar and Tags
While users can use the explore function to find new posts to like, a search bar would be great in tandem with tags to supply users with exactly what they'd like with the fewest key strokes.
